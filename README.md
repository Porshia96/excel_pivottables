This project demonstrates how Excel PivotTables can be used to analyze raw sales data. The dataset contains sales transactions across different regions, representatives, and products. 
Using PivotTables, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize sales, identify patterns, and visualize trends.
The goal is to show how raw data, PivotTables, insights & visuals can help in decision-making.
